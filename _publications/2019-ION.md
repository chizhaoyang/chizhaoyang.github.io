excerpt: 'As the population of natural pollinators declines, there is an increased desire to supplement their functionally artificially. To
support agriculture productions when natural pollinators are not available, a methodology for realizing artificial pollination that
has received considerable interest – both within the academic and commercial communities – is the utilization of autonomous
robotic systems. One essential component within the complex architecture of an autonomous pollinating robot is an accurate,
efficient, and robust localization and mapping subsystem (i.e., a subsystem that maps the environment and localizes the robot).
This paper details the algorithmic design of a factor-graph based localization and mapping subsystem used to operate within
a greenhouse environment. The presented system is validated on multiple collected data-sets both in the greenhouse and an
outdoor farm.'

As the population of natural pollinators declines, there is an increased desire to supplement their functionally artificially. To
support agriculture productions when natural pollinators are not available, a methodology for realizing artificial pollination that
has received considerable interest – both within the academic and commercial communities – is the utilization of autonomous
robotic systems. One essential component within the complex architecture of an autonomous pollinating robot is an accurate,
efficient, and robust localization and mapping subsystem (i.e., a subsystem that maps the environment and localizes the robot).
This paper details the algorithmic design of a factor-graph based localization and mapping subsystem used to operate within
a greenhouse environment. The presented system is validated on multiple collected data-sets both in the greenhouse and an
outdoor farm.
