About Me
======

My name is Chizhao Yang. I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate advised by [Dr. Yu Gu](https://yugu.faculty.wvu.edu/people/current-members/yu-gu) at West Virginia University (WVU). I am also working as a Graduate Research Assistant at WVU Interactive Robotics Laboratory ([IRL](https://yugu.faculty.wvu.edu/home)). In our lab, my labmates and I are enjoying building real robots and testing them in challenging physical environments. I love working on every robot-related stuff, such as algorithm design, software coding, hardware building, and physical experiments. I really appreciate the lessons I learned from building robots. It teaches me how to persist, how to think diversity, how to share, how to make life better. Every time the robot works, I know I am the happiest human at that time in the world.
