Human-Robot Collaboration In Smart Warehouses
===
Safety is of critical concern in human-robot collaboration. A human-in-the-loop experiment was conducted to assess the performance of the customized robot control scheme in a smart warehouse setting, where the human participants performed order picking and assembly tasks, and the mobile robot performed simulated pallet moving tasks.

In this project, I applied a 2D navigation framework on the Freight Base Robot for driving the robot safely and reliably with human operatiors present in close quarters.
